Challenges:

Main challenge: use the area's resources to enhance sustainability

TechnoAlpin: recognize typical infrastructure in a ski resort by using AI algorithms on satellite images or other sources of picture material

WÃ¼rth-Phoenix: analysis of an action(photo upload) over the course of 2 days and cleaning/visualizing the data

Raiffeisen: reinvent the interaction with the bank according to your vision. Develop your own tailored smartphone application that reflects your imagination of a smart operating bank with a high coolness factor.




Our ideas merged into one big idea:

Use a mobile device on top of the slope(while skiing, biking, or hiking) in order to receive detailed information about any combination of the following outputs:

- upcoming weather conditions
- difficulty/risk of slope/hike
- vistas, terrain features, nature
- number of skiers/hikers/bikers

...based on one's input choice of:

- food preference
- average price or amount of total expense
- interests(i.e. tenting)
- slope difficulty
- path(i.e. cardinal direction)
- weather
- needs(i.e. mountain rescue if you are lost)
